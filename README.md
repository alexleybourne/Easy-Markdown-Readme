**About:**

Built using [ShowdownJS](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)
This is a simple website to create markdown files for merge requests and more
with features such as automatically putting images into tables with title corresponding to the file names.

for example: `before.png` & `after.png` when added to the file would be automatically formatted into a table

| Before | After |
|--|--|
